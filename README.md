## 🔭 Overview

**Scout: Agentic Company Researcher** is an AI-powered platform for efficient company analysis and automated account plan generation. It combines conversational interaction with structured data extraction, allowing users to explore organizations naturally while the system compiles accurate, well-organized research in real time. Designed for both quick fact-gathering and deeper exploration, it adapts to any user style and keeps context throughout the conversation.

Whether you're an **Efficient User** who just wants the numbers, or a **Chatty User** who likes to explore ideas, the system adapts to you—not the other way around.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🧠 Intelligent Research Agent**: Context-aware conversations that synthesize information and adapt to user personas (Confused, Efficient, Chatty).
- **📊 Dynamic Account Planning**: Real-time updates to structured account plans with Markdown support and dynamic section management.
- **🛡️ Enterprise-Grade Foundation**: Secure Google OAuth, type-safe tRPC API, and robust PostgreSQL database.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v20 or higher
- **PostgreSQL**: A running instance (or Neon account)
- **Google Cloud Console**: Project with OAuth credentials

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/agentic-company-researcher.git
   cd agentic-company-researcher
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**

   Create `.env` files based on examples:

   **`apps/server/.env`**

   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="..."
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="..."
   BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="..."
   GEMINI_API_KEY="..."
   CLIENT_URL="http://localhost:3000"
   ```

   **`apps/web/.env.local`**

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL="http://localhost:3001"
   ```

4. **Database Initialization**

   ```bash
   # Generate Prisma Client
   pnpm db:generate

   # Push schema to DB
   pnpm db:push
   ```

5. **Run Development Server**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Backend: `http://localhost:3001`

## 💡 Design Decisions

### 🧠 Intelligence & Personas

- **System Prompts**: We use specialized prompts (`packages/api/src/constants/systemPrompts.ts`) to handle different user types.
  - _Research Assistant_: Helpful and professional.
  - _Efficient User_: Direct, bulleted data.
  - _Confused User_: Educational and guiding.
  - _Chatty Partner_: Conversational but goal-oriented.
  - _Edge Case Validator_: Graceful error handling.
- **Dual-State Architecture**: We separate **Conversation State** (chat history) from **Document State** (structured report). The AI distinguishes between "chatting" and "fact-finding" to keep the report clean.
- **Adaptive Creativity**: We use low temperature for facts (revenue) and high temperature for strategy (SWOT analysis).

### 🤖 Model Agnostic LLM Layer

- **Vendor Independence**: Built with Vercel AI SDK to abstract the provider.
- **Task-Specific Routing**: Use different models for different tasks (e.g., Grok for reasoning, Gemini for speed).
- **Future Proofing**: Easily upgrade models via environment variables.

### 🏗️ Engineering & Scalability

- **Turbo Monorepo**: Shared code (`api`, `auth`, `db`) across packages for maintainability.
- **Independent Scaling**: Decoupled frontend (`web`) and backend (`server`).
- **tRPC**: End-to-end type safety without boilerplate. Backend changes trigger immediate frontend errors.

### 🛡️ Trust & Transparency

- **Conflict Detection**: The AI flags conflicting data points instead of guessing.
- **Uncertainty**: The model is trained to admit when it doesn't know something, ensuring intellectual honesty.

## 🧪 Evaluation & Testing

The system is designed to handle specific user personas defined in the evaluation criteria:

1. **The Confused User**:
   - _Behavior_: "I don't know what to do."
   - _System Response_: Proactively suggests companies and explains capabilities.
2. **The Efficient User**:

   - _Behavior_: "Give me revenue for Apple, Microsoft, and Google."
   - _System Response_: Returns a table of data immediately without fluff.

3. **The Chatty User**:

   - _Behavior_: Conversational, off-topic.
   - _System Response_: Engages politely but steers back to business goals.

4. **The Edge Case**:
   - _Behavior_: Malformed inputs, system attacks.
   - _System Response_: Graceful error handling and fallback responses.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Issue                   | Solution                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Build Fails**         | Ensure `pnpm-lock.yaml` is up to date. Run `pnpm install`.         |
| **Auth Redirect 404**   | Check `CLIENT_URL` in server env and Google Console redirect URIs. |
| **Prisma Client Error** | Run `pnpm db:generate` in the root or `packages/db`.               |
| **CORS Errors**         | Verify `cors` middleware config in `apps/server/src/index.ts`.     |
